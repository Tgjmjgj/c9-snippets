# c9-snippets   

This is "snippets" for the Cloud 9 IDE.

Add this plugin to the editor and you'll be able to add code completion snippets
the editor.

Currently the plugin creates a snippets folder with a sample snippet in it that 
you can activate by typing html5 and then Command-Shift-U (Ctrl-Shift-U on PC).

The "html5" text will be replaced with the contents of the html5 file in the 
snippets folder.

To add a snippet, just create a new file in the snippets folder named with something
that is easy for you to remember. Type that name in the editor, press Command-Shift-U
and the contents of the file will replace what you just typed.

TODO: add some additional snippets, and a nice UX for creating snippets. Might be 
nice to make the snippets a web service so that they can be shared and don't rely
on local files to work.
